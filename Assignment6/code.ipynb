Later simplified Transformer was shown to achieve great performance in language modeling tasks, like in encoder-only BERT or decoder-only GPT.\\nAttention and Self-Attention#\\nAttention is a mechanism in neural network that a model can learn to make predictions by selectively attending to a given set of data. The amount of attention is quantified by learned weights and thus the output is usually formed as a weighted average.\\nSelf-attention is a type of attention mechanism where the model makes prediction for one part of a data sample using other parts of the observation about the same sample. Conceptually, it feels quite similar to non-local means. Also note that self-attention is permutation-invariant; in other words, it is an operation on sets.\\nThere are various forms of attention / self-attention, Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) relies on the scaled dot-product attention: given a query matrix $\\\\mathbf{Q}$, a key matrix $\\\\mathbf{K}$ and a value matrix $\\\\mathbf{V}$, the output is a weighted sum of the value vectors, where the weight assigned to each value slot is determined by the dot-product of the query with the corresponding key:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{attn}(\\\\mathbf{Q}, \\\\mathbf{K}, \\\\mathbf{V}) = \\\\text{softmax}(\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{Q} {\\\\mathbf{K}}^\\\\top}{\\\\sqrt{d_k}})\\\\mathbf{V}\\n$$\\n\\nAnd for a query and a key vector $\\\\mathbf{q}_i, \\\\mathbf{k}_j \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d$ (row vectors in query and key matrices), we have a scalar score:\\n\\n$$\\na_{ij} = \\\\text{softmax}(\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{q}_i {\\\\mathbf{k}_j}^\\\\top}{\\\\sqrt{d_k}})\\n= \\\\frac{\\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{q}_i {\\\\mathbf{k}_j}^\\\\top}{\\\\sqrt{d_k}})}{ \\\\sum_{r \\\\in \\\\mathcal{S}_i} \\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{q}_i {\\\\mathbf{k}_r}^\\\\top}{\\\\sqrt{d_k}}) }\\n$$ \\n\\nwhere $\\\\mathcal{S}_i$ is a collection of key positions for the $i$-th query to attend to.\\nSee my old post for other types of attention if interested.\\nMulti-Head Self-Attention#\\nThe multi-head self-attention module is a key component in Transformer. Rather than only computing the attention once, the multi-head mechanism splits the inputs into smaller chunks and then computes the scaled dot-product attention over each subspace in parallel. The independent attention outputs are simply concatenated and linearly transformed into expected dimensions.\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\text{MultiHeadAttn}(\\\\mathbf{X}_q, \\\\mathbf{X}_k, \\\\mathbf{X}_v) &= [\\\\text{head}_1; \\\\dots; \\\\text{head}_h] \\\\mathbf{W}^o \\\\\\\\ \\n\\\\text{where head}_i &= \\\\text{Attention}(\\\\mathbf{X}_q\\\\mathbf{W}^q_i, \\\\mathbf{X}_k\\\\mathbf{W}^k_i, \\\\mathbf{X}_v\\\\mathbf{W}^v_i)\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $[.;.]$ is a concatenation operation. $\\\\mathbf{W}^q_i, \\\\mathbf{W}^k_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{d \\\\times d_k/h}, \\\\mathbf{W}^v_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{d \\\\times d_v/h}$ are weight matrices to map input embeddings of size $L \\\\times d$ into query, key and value matrices. And $\\\\mathbf{W}^o \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{d_v \\\\times d}$ is the output linear transformation. All the weights should be learned during training.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the multi-head scaled dot-product attention mechanism. (Image source: Figure 2 in Vaswani, et al., 2017)\\n\\nEncoder-Decoder Architecture#\\nThe encoder generates an attention-based representation with capability to locate a specific piece of information from a large context. It consists of a stack of 6 identity modules, each containing two submodules, a multi-head self-attention layer and a point-wise fully connected feed-forward network. By point-wise, it means that it applies the same linear transformation (with same weights) to each element in the sequence. This can also be viewed as a convolutional layer with filter size 1. Each submodule has a residual connection and layer normalization. All the submodules output data of the same dimension $d$.\\nThe function of Transformer decoder is to retrieve information from the encoded representation. The architecture is quite similar to the encoder, except that the decoder contains two multi-head attention submodules instead of one in each identical repeating module. The first multi-head attention submodule is masked to prevent positions from attending to the future.\\n\\n\\nThe architecture of the vanilla Transformer model. (Image source: Figure 17)\\n\\nPositional Encoding#\\nBecause self-attention operation is permutation invariant, it is important to use proper positional encoding to provide order information to the model. The positional encoding $\\\\mathbf{P} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{L \\\\times d}$ has the same dimension as the input embedding, so it can be added on the input directly. The vanilla Transformer considered two types of encodings:\\nSinusoidal Positional Encoding#\\nSinusoidal positional encoding is defined as follows, given the token position $i=1,\\\\dots,L$ and the dimension $\\\\delta=1,\\\\dots,d$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{PE}(i,\\\\delta) = \\n\\\\begin{cases}\\n\\\\sin(\\\\frac{i}{10000^{2\\\\delta\\'/d}}) & \\\\text{if } \\\\delta = 2\\\\delta\\'\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\cos(\\\\frac{i}{10000^{2\\\\delta\\'/d}}) & \\\\text{if } \\\\delta = 2\\\\delta\\' + 1\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n$$\\n\\nIn this way each dimension of the positional encoding corresponds to a sinusoid of different wavelengths in different dimensions, from $2\\\\pi$ to $10000 \\\\cdot 2\\\\pi$.\\n\\n\\nSinusoidal positional encoding with $L=32$ and $d=128$. The value is between -1 (black) and 1 (white) and the value 0 is in gray.\\n\\nLearned Positional Encoding#\\nLearned positional encoding assigns each element with a learned column vector which encodes its absolute position (Gehring, et al. 2017) and furthermroe this encoding can be learned differently per layer (Al-Rfou et al. 2018).\\nRelative Position Encoding#\\nShaw et al. (2018)) incorporated relative positional information into $\\\\mathbf{W}^k$ and $\\\\mathbf{W}^v$. Maximum relative position is clipped to a maximum absolute value of $k$ and this clipping operation enables the model to generalize to unseen sequence lengths. Therefore, $2k + 1$ unique edge labels are considered and let us denote $\\\\mathbf{P}^k, \\\\mathbf{P}^v \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{2k+1}$ as learnable relative position representations.\\n\\n$$\\nA_{ij}^k = P^k_{\\\\text{clip}(j - i, k)} \\\\quad\\nA_{ij}^v = P^v_{\\\\text{clip}(j - i, k)} \\\\quad\\n\\\\text{where }\\\\text{clip}(x, k) = \\\\text{clip}(x, -k, k)\\n$$\\n\\nTransformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a type of relative positional encoding based on reparametrization of dot-product of keys and queries. To keep the positional information flow coherently across segments, Transformer-XL encodes the relative position instead, as it could be sufficient enough to know the position offset for making good predictions, i.e. $i-j$, between one key vector $\\\\mathbf{k}_{\\\\tau, j}$ and its query $\\\\mathbf{q}_{\\\\tau, i}$.\\nIf omitting the scalar $1/\\\\sqrt{d_k}$ and the normalizing term in softmax but including positional encodings, we can write the attention score between query at position $i$ and key at position $j$ as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\na_{ij} \\n&= \\\\mathbf{q}_i {\\\\mathbf{k}_j}^\\\\top = (\\\\mathbf{x}_i + \\\\mathbf{p}_i)\\\\mathbf{W}^q ((\\\\mathbf{x}_j + \\\\mathbf{p}_j)\\\\mathbf{W}^k)^\\\\top \\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\mathbf{x}_i\\\\mathbf{W}^q {\\\\mathbf{W}^k}^\\\\top\\\\mathbf{x}_j^\\\\top + \\\\mathbf{x}_i\\\\mathbf{W}^q {\\\\mathbf{W}^k}^\\\\top\\\\mathbf{p}_j^\\\\top + \\\\mathbf{p}_i\\\\mathbf{W}^q {\\\\mathbf{W}^k}^\\\\top\\\\mathbf{x}_j^\\\\top + \\\\mathbf{p}_i\\\\mathbf{W}^q {\\\\mathbf{W}^k}^\\\\top\\\\mathbf{p}_j^\\\\top\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nTransformer-XL reparameterizes the above four terms as follows:\\n\\n$$\\na_{ij}^\\\\text{rel} = \\n\\\\underbrace{ \\\\mathbf{x}_i\\\\mathbf{W}^q \\\\color{blue}{ {\\\\mathbf{W}_E^k}^\\\\top } \\\\mathbf{x}_j^\\\\top }_\\\\text{content-based addressing} + \\n\\\\underbrace{ \\\\mathbf{x}_i\\\\mathbf{W}^q \\\\color{blue}{ {\\\\mathbf{W}_R^k}^\\\\top } \\\\color{green}{\\\\mathbf{r}_{i-j}^\\\\top} }_\\\\text{content-dependent positional bias} + \\n\\\\underbrace{ \\\\color{red}{\\\\mathbf{u}} \\\\color{blue}{ {\\\\mathbf{W}_E^k}^\\\\top } \\\\mathbf{x}_j^\\\\top }_\\\\text{global content bias} + \\n\\\\underbrace{ \\\\color{red}{\\\\mathbf{v}} \\\\color{blue}{ {\\\\mathbf{W}_R^k}^\\\\top } \\\\color{green}{\\\\mathbf{r}_{i-j}^\\\\top} }_\\\\text{global positional bias}\\n$$\\n\\n\\nReplace $\\\\mathbf{p}_j$ with relative positional encoding $\\\\mathbf{r}_{i-j} \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R}^{d}$;\\nReplace $\\\\mathbf{p}_i\\\\mathbf{W}^q$ with two trainable parameters $\\\\mathbf{u}$ (for content) and $\\\\mathbf{v}$ (for location) in two different terms;\\nSplit $\\\\mathbf{W}^k$ into two matrices, $\\\\mathbf{W}^k_E$ for content information and $\\\\mathbf{W}^k_R$ for location information.\\n\\nRotary Position Embedding#\\nRotary position embedding (RoPE; Su et al. 2021) encodes the absolution position with a rotation matrix and multiplies key and value matrices of every attention layer with it to inject relative positional information at every layer.\\nWhen encoding relative positional information into the inner product of the $i$-th key and the $j$-th query, we would like to formulate the function in a way that the inner product is only about the relative position $i-j$. Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) makes use of the rotation operation in Euclidean space and frames the relative position embedding as simply rotating feature matrix by an angle proportional to its position index.\\nGiven a vector $\\\\mathbf{z}$, if we want to rotate it counterclockwise by $\\\\theta$, we can multiply it by a rotation matrix to get $R\\\\mathbf{z}$ where the rotation matrix $R$ is defined as:\\n\\n$$\\nR = \\\\begin{bmatrix}\\n\\\\cos\\\\theta & -\\\\sin\\\\theta \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\sin\\\\theta & \\\\cos\\\\theta\\n\\\\end{bmatrix}\\n$$\\n\\nWhen generalizing to higher dimensional space, RoPE divide the $d$-dimensional space into $d/2$ subspaces and constructs a rotation matrix $R$ of size $d \\\\times d$ for token at position $i$:\\n\\n$$\\nR^d_{\\\\Theta, i} = \\\\begin{bmatrix}\\n\\\\cos i\\\\theta_1 & -\\\\sin i\\\\theta_1 & 0 & 0 & \\\\dots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\sin i\\\\theta_1 & \\\\cos i\\\\theta_1 & 0 & 0 & \\\\dots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n0 & 0 & \\\\cos i\\\\theta_2 & -\\\\sin i\\\\theta_2 & \\\\dots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n0 & 0 & \\\\sin i\\\\theta_2 & \\\\cos i\\\\theta_2 & \\\\dots & 0 & 0 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\dots & \\\\cos i\\\\theta_{d/2} & -\\\\sin i\\\\theta_{d/2} \\\\\\\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\dots & \\\\sin i\\\\theta_{d/2} & \\\\cos i\\\\theta_{d/2} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{bmatrix}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere in the paper we have $\\\\Theta = {\\\\theta_i = 10000^{-2(i−1)/d}, i \\\\in [1, 2, …, d/2]}$. Note that this is essentially equivalent to sinusoidal positional encoding but formulated as a rotation matrix.\\nThen both key and query matrices incorporates the positional information by multiplying with this rotation matrix:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n& \\\\mathbf{q}_i^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{k}_j = (R^d_{\\\\Theta, i} \\\\mathbf{W}^q\\\\mathbf{x}_i)^\\\\top (R^d_{\\\\Theta, j} \\\\mathbf{W}^k\\\\mathbf{x}_j) = \\\\mathbf{x}_i^\\\\top\\\\mathbf{W}^q R^d_{\\\\Theta, j-i}\\\\mathbf{W}^k\\\\mathbf{x}_j \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\text{ where } R^d_{\\\\Theta, j-i} = (R^d_{\\\\Theta, i})^\\\\top R^d_{\\\\Theta, j}\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\n\\n\\nVisual illustration of how rotary position embedding is implemented.(Image source: Su et al., 2021) Note: I used $i$ instead of $m$ to represent the position index compared to the original figure in the paper.\\n\\nLonger Context#\\nThe length of an input sequence for transformer models at inference time is upper-bounded by the context length used for training. Naively increasing context length leads to high consumption in both time ($\\\\mathcal{O}(L^2d)$) and memory ($\\\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$) and may not be supported due to hardware constraints.\\nThis section introduces several improvements in transformer architecture to better support long context at inference; E.g. using additional memory, design for better context extrapolation, or recurrency mechanism.\\nContext Memory#\\nThe vanilla Transformer has a fixed and limited attention span. The model can only attend to other elements in the same segments during each update step and no information can flow across separated fixed-length segments. This context segmentation causes several issues:\\n\\nThe model cannot capture very long term dependencies.\\nIt is hard to predict the first few tokens in each segment given no or thin context.\\nThe evaluation is expensive. Whenever the segment is shifted  to the right by one, the new segment is re-processed from scratch, although there are a lot of overlapped tokens.\\n\\nTransformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019; “XL” means “extra long”) modifies the architecture to reuse hidden states between segments with an additional memory. The recurrent connection between segments is introduced into the model by continuously using the hidden states from the previous segments.\\n\\n\\nA comparison between the training phrase of vanilla Transformer & Transformer-XL with a segment length 4. (Image source: left part of Figure 2 in Dai et al., 2019).\\n\\nLet’s label the hidden state of the $n$-th layer for the $(\\\\tau + 1)$-th segment in the model as $\\\\mathbf{h}_{\\\\tau+1}^{(n)} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{L \\\\times d}$. In addition to the hidden state of the last layer for the same segment $\\\\mathbf{h}_{\\\\tau+1}^{(n-1)}$, it also depends on the hidden state of the same layer for the previous segment $\\\\mathbf{h}_{\\\\tau}^{(n)}$.  By incorporating information from the previous hidden states, the model extends the attention span much longer in the past, over multiple segments.\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\color{red}{\\\\widetilde{\\\\mathbf{h}}_{\\\\tau+1}^{(n-1)}} &= [\\\\text{stop-gradient}(\\\\mathbf{h}_{\\\\tau}^{(n-1)}) \\\\circ \\\\mathbf{h}_{\\\\tau+1}^{(n-1)}] \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mathbf{Q}_{\\\\tau+1}^{(n)} &= \\\\mathbf{h}_{\\\\tau+1}^{(n-1)}\\\\mathbf{W}^q \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mathbf{K}_{\\\\tau+1}^{(n)} &= \\\\color{red}{\\\\widetilde{\\\\mathbf{h}}_{\\\\tau+1}^{(n-1)}} \\\\mathbf{W}^k \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mathbf{V}_{\\\\tau+1}^{(n)} &= \\\\color{red}{\\\\widetilde{\\\\mathbf{h}}_{\\\\tau+1}^{(n-1)}} \\\\mathbf{W}^v \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mathbf{h}_{\\\\tau+1}^{(n)} &= \\\\text{transformer-layer}(\\\\mathbf{Q}_{\\\\tau+1}^{(n)}, \\\\mathbf{K}_{\\\\tau+1}^{(n)}, \\\\mathbf{V}_{\\\\tau+1}^{(n)})\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nNote that both keys and values rely on extended hidden states, while queries only consume hidden states at the current step. The concatenation operation $[. \\\\circ .]$ is along the sequence length dimension. And Transformer-XL needs to use relative positional encoding because previous and current segments would be assigned with the same encoding if we encode absolute positions, which is undesired.\\nCompressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) extends Transformer-XL by compressing past memories to support longer sequences. It explicitly adds memory slots of size $m_m$ per layer for storing past activations of this layer to preserve long context. When some past activations become old enough, they are compressed and saved in an additional compressed memory of size $m_{cm}$ per layer.\\n\\n\\nCompressive transformer maintains two types of memory slots, memory and compressed memory, to support long context. (Image source: Rae et al. 2019).\\n\\nBoth memory and compressed memory are FIFO queues. Given the model context length $L$, the compression function of compression rate $c$ is defined as $f_c: \\\\mathbb{R}^{L \\\\times d} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^{[\\\\frac{L}{c}] \\\\times d}$, mapping $L$ oldest activations to $[\\\\frac{L}{c}]$ compressed memory elements. There are several choices of compression functions:\\n\\nMax/mean pooling of kernel and stride size $c$;\\n1D convolution with kernel and stride size $c$ (need to learn additional parameters);\\nDilated convolution (need to learn additional parameters). In their experiments, convolution compression works out the best on EnWik8 dataset;\\nMost used memories.\\n\\nCompressive transformer has two additional training losses:\\n\\n\\nAuto-encoding loss (lossless compression objective) measures how well we can reconstruct the original memories from compressed memories\\n\\n $$\\n \\\\mathcal{L}_{ac} = \\\\| \\\\textbf{old_mem}^{(i)} - g(\\\\textbf{new_cm}^{(i)}) \\\\|_2\\n $$\\n \\n where $g: \\\\mathbb{R}^{[\\\\frac{L}{c}] \\\\times d} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^{L \\\\times d}$ reverses the compression function $f$.\\n\\n\\nAttention-reconstruction loss (lossy objective) reconstructs content-based attention over memory vs compressed memory and minimize the difference:\\n\\n $$\\n \\\\mathcal{L}_{ar} = \\\\|\\\\text{attn}(\\\\mathbf{h}^{(i)}, \\\\textbf{old_mem}^{(i)}) − \\\\text{attn}(\\\\mathbf{h}^{(i)}, \\\\textbf{new_cm}^{(i)})\\\\|_2\\n $$\\n \\n\\n\\nTransformer-XL with a memory of size $m$ has a maximum temporal range of $m \\\\times N$, where $N$ is the number of layers in the model, and attention cost $\\\\mathcal{O}(L^2 + Lm)$. In comparison, compressed transformer has a temporal range of $(m_m + c \\\\cdot m_{cm}) \\\\times N$ and attention cost $\\\\mathcal{O}(L^2 + L(m_m + m_{cm}))$. A larger compression rate $c$ gives better tradeoff between temporal range length and attention cost.\\nAttention weights, from oldest to newest, are stored in three locations: compressed memory → memory → causally masked sequence. In the experiments, they observed an increase in attention weights from oldest activations stored in the regular memory, to activations stored in the compressed memory, implying that the network is learning to preserve salient information.\\n\\n\\nAttention weights with one standard deviation as error bars versus memory positions, from oldest (left) to newest (right). (Image source: Rae et al. 2019).\\n\\nNon-Differentiable External Memory#\\n$k$NN-LM (Khandelwal et al. 2020) enhances a pretrained LM with a separate $k$NN model by linearly interpolating the next token probabilities predicted by both models. The $k$NN model is built upon an external key-value store  which can store any large pre-training dataset or OOD new dataset. This datastore is preprocessed to save a large number of pairs, (LM embedding representation of context, next token) and the nearest neighbor retrieval happens in the LM embedding space. Because the datastore can be gigantic, we need to rely on libraries for fast dense vector search such as FAISS or ScaNN. The indexing process only happens once and parallelism is easy to implement at inference time.\\nAt inference time, the next token probability is a weighted sum of two predictions:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\np(y \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{x}) &= \\\\lambda \\\\; p_\\\\text{kNN}(y \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{x}) + (1- \\\\lambda) \\\\; p_\\\\text{LM}(y \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\\\\\\\np_\\\\text{kNN}(y \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{x}) &\\\\propto \\\\sum_{(k_i, w_i) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{N}} \\\\mathbb{1}[y = w_i] \\\\exp(-d(k_i, f(\\\\mathbf{x})))\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\mathcal{N}$ contains a set of nearest neighbor data points retrieved by $k$NN; $d(., .)$ is a distance function such as L2 distance.\\nAccording to the experiments, larger datastore size or larger $k$ is correlated with better perplexity. The weighting scalar $\\\\lambda$ should be tuned, but in general it is expected to be larger for out-of-domain data compared to in-domain data and larger datastore can afford a larger $\\\\lambda$.\\nSPALM (Adaptive semiparametric language models; Yogatama et al. 2021) incorporates both (1) Transformer-XL style memory for hidden states from external context as short-term memory and (2) $k$NN-LM style key-value store as long memory.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how SPALM combines context memory of past hidden states (short term memory) with an external key-value datastore (long term memory) to support longer context. (Image source: Yogatama et al. 2021).\\n\\nSPALM runs $k$NN search to fetch $k$ tokens with most relevant context. For each token we can get the same embedding representation provided by a pretrained LM, denoted as $\\\\{\\\\mathbf{y}_i\\\\}_{i=1}^k$. The gating mechanism first aggregates the retrieved token embeddings with a simple attention layer using $\\\\mathbf{h}^R_t$ (the hidden state for token $x_t$ at layer $R$) as a query and then learns a gating parameter $\\\\mathbf{g}_t$ to balance between local information $\\\\mathbf{h}^R_t$ and long-term information $\\\\mathbf{m}_t$.\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\mathbf{m}_t &= \\\\sum_{i=1}^k \\\\frac{\\\\exp(\\\\mathbf{y}_i^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{h}^R_t)}{\\\\sum_{j=1}^k \\\\exp(\\\\mathbf{y}_j^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{h}^R_t)} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{y}_i \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mathbf{g}_t &= \\\\sigma(\\\\mathbf{w}_g^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{h}_t^R) \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mathbf{z}_t &= (1 - \\\\mathbf{g}_t) \\\\odot \\\\mathbf{m}_t + \\\\mathbf{g}_t \\\\odot \\\\mathbf{h}^R_t \\\\\\\\\\np(x_{t+1}\\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x}_{\\\\leq t}) &= \\\\text{softmax}(\\\\mathbf{z}_t; \\\\mathbf{W})\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\mathbf{w}_g$ is a parameter vector to learn; $\\\\sigma(.)$ is sigmoid; $\\\\mathbf{W}$ is the word embedding matrix shared between both input and output tokens. Different from $k$NN-LM, they didn’t find the nearest neighbor distance to be helpful in the aggregation of retrieved tokens.\\nDuring training, the key representations in the long-term memory stay constant, produced by a pretrained LM, but the value encoder, aka the word embedding matrix, gets updated.\\nMemorizing Transformer (Wu et al. 2022) adds a $k$NN-augmented attention layer near the top stack of a decoder-only Transformer. This special layer maintains a Transformer-XL style FIFO cache of past key-value pairs.\\nThe same QKV values are used for both local attention and $k$NN mechanisms. The $k$NN lookup returns top-$k$ (key, value) pairs for each query in the input sequence and then they are processed through the self-attention stack to compute a weighted average of retrieved values. Two types of attention are combined with a learnable per-head gating parameter. To prevent large distributional shifts in value magnitude, both keys and values in the cache are normalized.\\nWhat they found during experiments with Memorizing Transformer:\\n\\nIt is observed in some experiments that training models with a small memory and then finetuned with a larger memory works better than training with a large memory from scratch.\\nThe smaller Memorizing Transformer with just 8k tokens in memory can match the perplexity of a larger vanilla Transformer with 5X more trainable parameters.\\nIncreasing the size of external memory provided consistent gains up to a size of 262K.\\nA  non-memory transformer can be finetuned to use memory.\\n\\n\\n\\nFine-tuning a vanilla Transformer with a key-value memory can achieve similar performance as training a memorizing transformer from scratch. (Image source: Wu et al. 2022).\\n\\nDistance-Enhanced Attention Scores#\\nDistance Aware Transformer(DA-Transformer;\\nWu, et al. 2021) and Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi; Press et al. 2022) are motivated by similar ideas — in order to encourage the model to extrapolate over longer context than what the model is trained on, we can explicitly attach the positional information to every pair of attention score based on the distance between key and query tokens.\\nNote that the default positional encoding in vanilla Transformer only adds positional information to the input sequence, while later improved encoding mechanisms alter attention scores of every layer, such as rotary position embedding, and they take on form very similar to distance enhanced attention scores.\\nDA-Transformer (Wu, et al. 2021) multiplies attention scores at each layer by a learnable bias that is formulated as a function of the distance between key and query. Different attention heads use different parameters to distinguish diverse preferences to short-term vs long-term context. Given two positions, $i, j$, DA-Transformer uses the following weighting function to alter the self-attention score:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\mathbf{R}^{(i)} &= \\\\alpha_i \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\quad \\\\text{where }R_{ij} = \\\\vert i-j \\\\vert\\\\\\\\\\nf(\\\\mathbf{R}^{(i)}; \\\\beta_i) &= \\\\frac{1 + \\\\exp(\\\\beta_i)}{1 + \\\\exp(\\\\beta_i - \\\\mathbf{R}^{(i)})} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{attn}(\\\\mathbf{Q}^{(i)}, \\\\mathbf{K}^{(i)}, \\\\mathbf{V}^{(i)}) &= \\\\text{row-softmax}\\\\Big(\\\\frac{\\\\text{ReLU}(\\\\mathbf{Q}^{(i)}\\\\mathbf{K}^{(i)\\\\top})f(\\\\mathbf{R}^{(i)})}{\\\\sqrt{d}}\\\\Big) \\\\mathbf{V}^{(i)}\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\alpha_i$ is a learnable parameters to weight relative distance differently per head where the head is indexed by superscript $^{(i)}$; $\\\\beta_i$ is a learnable parameter to control the upper bound and ascending slope wrt the distance for the $i$-th attention head. The weighting function $f(.)$ is designed in a way that: (1) $f(0)=1$; (2) $f(\\\\mathbf{R}^{(i)}) = 0$ when $\\\\mathbf{R}^{(i)} \\\\to -\\\\infty$; (3) $f(\\\\mathbf{R}^{(i)})$ is bounded when $\\\\mathbf{R}^{(i)} \\\\to +\\\\infty$; (4) the scale is tunable; (5) and the function is monotonic. The extra time complexity brought by $f(\\\\mathbf{R}^{(i)})$ is $\\\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ and it is small relative to the self attention time complexity $\\\\mathcal{O}(L^2 d)$. The extra memory consumption is minimal, ~$\\\\mathcal{O}(2h)$.\\nInstead of multipliers, ALiBi (Press et al. 2022) adds a constant bias term on query-key attention scores, proportional to pairwise distances. The bias introduces a strong recency preference and penalizes keys that are too far away. The penalties are increased at different rates within different heads.\\n$$\\n\\\\text{softmax}(\\\\mathbf{q}_i \\\\mathbf{K}^\\\\top + \\\\alpha_i \\\\cdot [0, -1, -2, \\\\dots, -(i-1)])\\n$$\\nwhere $\\\\alpha_i$ is a head-specific weighting scalar. Different from DA-transformer, $\\\\alpha_i$ is not learned but fixed as a geometric sequence; for example, for 8 heads, ${\\\\alpha_i} = {\\\\frac{1}{2}, \\\\frac{1}{2^2}, \\\\dots, \\\\frac{1}{2^8}}$. The overall idea is very much similar to what relative positional encoding aims to solve.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how ALiBi enhances attention scores with a positional bias term. (Image source: Press et al. 2021).\\n\\nWith ALiBi, Press et al. (2022) trained a 1.3B model on context length 1024 during training and extrapolated to 2046 at inference time.\\n\\n\\nExtrapolation experiments for running inference with Transformers of different configs, including sinusoidal positional encoding, rotary positional encoding, simplified relative positional encoding in T5 and ALiBi. All models were trained with small context length but inference ran for much longer context. (Image source: Press et al. 2021).\\n\\nMake it Recurrent#\\nUniversal Transformer (Dehghani, et al. 2019) combines self-attention in Transformer with the recurrent mechanism in RNN, aiming to benefit from both a long-term global receptive field of Transformer and learned inductive biases of RNN. Rather than going through a fixed number of layers, Universal Transformer dynamically adjusts the number of steps using adaptive computation time. If we fix the number of steps, an Universal Transformer is equivalent to a multi-layer Transformer with shared parameters across layers.\\nOn a high level, the universal transformer can be viewed as a recurrent function for learning the hidden state representation per token. The recurrent function evolves in parallel across token positions and the information between positions is shared through self-attention.\\n\\n\\nHow the Universal Transformer refines a set of hidden state representations repeatedly for every position in parallel. (Image source: Figure 1 in Dehghani, et al. 2019).\\n\\nGiven an input sequence of length $L$, Universal Transformer iteratively updates the representation $\\\\mathbf{h}^t \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{L \\\\times d}$ at step $t$ for an adjustable number of steps. At step 0, $\\\\mathbf{h}^0$ is initialized to be same as the input embedding matrix. All the positions are processed in parallel in the multi-head self-attention mechanism and then go through a recurrent transition function.\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\mathbf{A}^t &= \\\\text{LayerNorm}(\\\\mathbf{h}^{t-1} + \\\\text{MultiHeadAttention}(\\\\mathbf{h}^{t-1} + \\\\mathbf{P}^t) \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mathbf{h}^t &= \\\\text{LayerNorm}(\\\\mathbf{A}^{t-1} + \\\\text{Transition}(\\\\mathbf{A}^t))\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\text{Transition}(.)$ is either a separable convolution or a fully-connected neural network that consists of two position-wise (i.e. applied to each row of $\\\\mathbf{A}^t$ individually) affine transformation + one ReLU.\\nThe positional encoding $\\\\mathbf{P}^t$ uses sinusoidal position signal but with an additional time dimension:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{PE}(i, t, \\\\delta) = \\n\\\\begin{cases}\\n\\\\sin(\\\\frac{i}{10000^{2\\\\delta\\'/d}}) \\\\oplus \\\\sin(\\\\frac{t}{10000^{2\\\\delta\\'/d}}) & \\\\text{if } \\\\delta = 2\\\\delta\\'\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\cos(\\\\frac{i}{10000^{2\\\\delta\\'/d}}) \\\\oplus \\\\cos(\\\\frac{t}{10000^{2\\\\delta\\'/d}}) & \\\\text{if } \\\\delta = 2\\\\delta\\' + 1\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n$$\\n\\n\\n\\nA simplified illustration of Universal Transformer. The encoder and decoder share the same basic recurrent structure. But the decoder also attends to final encoder representation $\\\\mathbf{h}^T$. (Image source: Figure 2 in Dehghani, et al. 2019)\\n\\nIn the adaptive version of Universal Transformer, the number of recurrent steps $T$ is dynamically determined by ACT. Each position is equipped with a dynamic ACT halting mechanism. Once a per-token recurrent block halts, it stops taking more recurrent updates but simply copies the current value to the next step until all the blocks halt or until the model reaches a maximum step limit.\\nAdaptive Modeling#\\nAdaptive modeling refers to a mechanism that can adjust the amount of computation according to different inputs. For example, some tokens may only need local information and thus demand a shorter attention span; Or some tokens are relatively easier to predict and do not need to be processed through the entire attention stack.\\nAdaptive Attention Span#\\nOne key advantage of Transformer is the capability of capturing long-term dependencies. Depending on the context, the model may prefer to attend further sometime than others; or one attention head may had different attention pattern from the other. If the attention span could adapt its length flexibly and only attend further back when needed, it would help reduce both computation and memory cost to support longer maximum context size in the model.\\nThis is the motivation for Adaptive Attention Span. Sukhbaatar et al (2019) proposed a self-attention mechanism that seeks an optimal attention span. They hypothesized that different attention heads might assign scores differently within the same context window (See Fig. 14) and thus the optimal span would be trained separately per head.\\n\\n\\nTwo attention heads in the same model, A & B, assign attention differently within the same context window. Head A attends more to the recent tokens, while head B look further back into the past uniformly. (Image source: Sukhbaatar, et al. 2019)\\n\\nGiven the $i$-th token, we need to compute the attention weights between this token and other keys within its attention span of size $s$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\ne_{ij} &= \\\\mathbf{q}_i {\\\\mathbf{k}_j}^\\\\top \\\\\\\\ \\na_{ij} &= \\\\text{softmax}(e_{ij}) = \\\\frac{\\\\exp(e_{ij})}{\\\\sum_{r=i-s}^{i-1} \\\\exp(e_{ir})} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\mathbf{y}_i &= \\\\sum_{r=i-s}^{i-1}a_{ir}\\\\mathbf{v}_r = \\\\sum_{r=i-s}^{i-1}a_{ir}\\\\mathbf{x}_r\\\\mathbf{W}^v\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nA soft mask function $m_z$ is added to control for an effective adjustable attention span, which maps the distance between query and key into a [0, 1] value. $m_z$ is parameterized by $z \\\\in [0, s]$ and $z$ is to be learned:\\n\\n$$\\nm_z(x) = \\\\text{clip}(\\\\frac{1}{R}(R+z-x), 0, 1)\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $R$ is a hyper-parameter which defines the softness of $m_z$.\\n\\n\\nThe soft masking function used in the adaptive attention span. (Image source: Sukhbaatar, et al. 2019.)\\n\\nThe soft mask function is applied to the softmax elements in the attention weights:\\n\\n$$\\na_{ij} = \\\\frac{m_z(i-j)\\\\exp(s_{ij})}{\\\\sum_{r=i-s}^{i-1}m_z(i-r) \\\\exp(s_{ir})}\\n$$\\n\\nIn the above equation, $z$ is differentiable so it is trained jointly with other parts of the model. Parameters $z^{(i)}, i=1, \\\\dots, h$ are learned separately per head. Moreover, the loss function has an extra L1 penalty on $\\\\sum_{i=1}^h z^{(i)}$.\\nUsing Adaptive Computation Time, the approach can be further enhanced to have flexible attention span length, adaptive to the current input dynamically. The span parameter $z_t$ of an attention head at time $t$ is a sigmoidal function, $z_t = S \\\\sigma(\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x}_t +b)$, where the vector $\\\\mathbf{v}$ and the bias scalar $b$ are learned jointly with other parameters.\\nIn the experiments of Transformer with adaptive attention span, Sukhbaatar, et al. (2019) found a general tendency that lower layers do not require very long attention spans, while a few attention heads in higher layers may use exceptionally long spans. Adaptive attention span also helps greatly reduce the number of FLOPS, especially in a big model with many attention layers and a large context length.\\nDepth-Adaptive Transformer#\\nAt inference time, it is natural to assume that some tokens are easier to predict and thus do not require as much computation as others. Therefore we may only process its prediction through a limited number of layers to achieve a good balance between speed and performance.\\nBoth Depth-Adaptive Transformer (Elabyad et al. 2020) and Confident Adaptive Language Model (CALM; Schuster et al. 2022) are motivated by this idea and learn to predict optimal numbers of layers needed for different input tokens.\\nDepth-adaptive transformer (Elabyad et al. 2020) attaches an output classifier to every layer to produce exit predictions based on activations of that layer. The classifier weight matrices can be different per layer or shared across layers. During training, the model sample different sequences of exits such that the model is optimized with hidden states of different layers. The learning objective incorporates likelihood probabilities predicted at different layers, $n=1, \\\\dots, N$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{LL}^n_t = \\\\log p(y_t \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{h}^n_{t-1}) \\\\quad\\n\\\\text{LL}^n = \\\\sum_{t=1}^{\\\\vert\\\\mathbf{y}\\\\vert} LL^n_t\\n$$ \\n\\nAdaptive depth classifiers outputs a parametric distribution $q_t$. It is trained with cross entropy loss against an oracle distribution $q^*_t$. The paper explored three confiurations for how to learn such a classifier $q_t$.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of three types of adaptive depth classifiers. (Image source: Elabyad et al. 2020).\\n\\n\\n\\nSequence-specific depth classifier: All tokens of the same sequence share the same exit block. It depends on the average of the encoder representation of the sequence. Given an input sequence $\\\\mathbf{x}$ of length $L$, the classifier takes $\\\\bar{\\\\mathbf{x}} = \\\\frac{1}{L} \\\\sum_{t=1}^L \\\\mathbf{x}_t$ as input and outputs a multinomial distribution of $N$ dimensions, corresponding to $N$ layers.\\n\\n $$\\n \\\\begin{aligned}\\n q(n \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{x}) &=\\\\text{softmax}(\\\\mathbf{W}_n \\\\bar{\\\\mathbf{x}} + b_n) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^N \\\\\\\\\\n q_\\\\text{lik}^*(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) &= \\\\delta(\\\\arg\\\\max_n \\\\text{LL}^n - \\\\lambda n) \\\\\\\\\\n \\\\text{or }q_\\\\text{corr}^*(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}) &= \\\\delta(\\\\arg\\\\max_n C^n - \\\\lambda n) \\\\text{ where }C^n = \\\\vert\\\\{t \\\\vert y_t = \\\\arg\\\\max_y p(y \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{h}^n_{t-1})\\\\}\\\\vert \\\\\\\\\\n \\\\end{aligned}\\n $$\\n \\nwhere $\\\\delta$ is dirac delta (unit impulse) function and $-\\\\lambda n$ is a regularization term to encourage lower layer exits. The ground truth $q^*$ can be prepared in two way, based on maximum likelihood $q_\\\\text{lik}^*$ or correctness $q_\\\\text{corr}^*$.\\n\\n\\n\\nToken-specific depth classifier (multinomial): Each token is decoded with different exit block, predicted conditioned on the first decoder hidden state $\\\\mathbf{h}^1_t$:\\n\\n $$\\n q_t(n \\\\vert \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{y}_{< t}) = \\\\text{softmax}(\\\\mathbf{W}_n \\\\mathbf{h}^1_t + b_n)\\n $$\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nToken-specific depth classifier (geometric-like):  A binary exit prediction distribution is made per layer per token, $\\\\mathcal{X}^n_t$.

Depth-adaptive transformer finds such a threshold on a validation set via grid search. CALM (Schuster et al. 2022) applied the Learn then Test (LTT) framework (Angelopoulos et al. 2021) to identify a subset of valid thresholds and chose the minimum value as the threshold for inference. Except for training per-layer exit classifier, CALM also explored other methods for adaptive depth prediction, including the softmax responses (i.e. difference between top two softmax outputs) and hidden state saturation (i.e. $\\\\cos(\\\\mathbf{h}^n_t, \\\\mathbf{h}^{n+1}_t)$) as confidence scores for exit decisions. They found softmax responses result in best inference speedup.\\nEfficient Attention#\\nThe computation and memory cost of the vanilla Transformer grows quadratically with sequence length and hence it is hard to be applied on very long sequences. Many efficiency improvements for Transformer architecture have something to do with the self-attention module - making it cheaper, smaller or faster to run. See the survey paper on Efficient Transformers (Tay et al. 2020).\\nSparse Attention Patterns#\\nFixed Local Context#\\nA simple alternation to make self-attention less expensive is to restrict the attention span of each token to local context only, so that self-attention grows linearly with the sequence length.\\nThe idea was introduced by Image Transformer (Parmer, et al 2018), which formulates image generation as sequence modeling using an encoder-decoder transformer architecture:\\n\\nThe encoder generates a contextualized, per-pixel-channel representation of the source image;\\nThen the decoder autoregressively generates an output image, one channel per pixel at each time step.\\n\\nLet’s label the representation of the current pixel to be generated as the query $\\\\mathbf{q}$. Other positions whose representations will be used for computing $\\\\mathbf{q}$ are key vector $\\\\mathbf{k}_1, \\\\mathbf{k}_2, \\\\dots$ and they together form a memory matrix $\\\\mathbf{M}$. The scope of $\\\\mathbf{M}$ defines the context window for pixel query $\\\\mathbf{q}$.\\nImage Transformer introduced two types of localized $\\\\mathbf{M}$, as illustrated below.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of 1D and 2D attention span for visual inputs in Image Transformer. The black line marks a query block and the cyan outlines the actual attention span for pixel q. (Image source: Figure 2 in Parmer et al, 2018)\\n\\n\\n\\n1D Local Attention: The input image is flattened in the raster scanning order, that is, from left to right and top to bottom. The linearized image is then partitioned into non-overlapping query blocks. The context window consists of pixels in the same query block as $\\\\mathbf{q}$ and a fixed number of additional pixels generated before this query block.\\n\\n\\n2D Local Attention: The image is partitioned into multiple non-overlapping rectangular query blocks. The query pixel can attend to all others in the same memory blocks. To make sure the pixel at the top-left corner can also have a valid context window, the memory block is extended to the top, left and right by a fixed amount, respectively.\\n\\n\\nStrided Context#\\nSparse Transformer (Child et al., 2019) introduced factorized self-attention, through sparse matrix factorization, making it possible to train dense attention networks with hundreds of layers on sequence length up to 16,384, which would be infeasible on modern hardware otherwise.\\nGiven a set of attention connectivity pattern $\\\\mathcal{S} = \\\\{S_1, \\\\dots, S_n\\\\}$, where each $S_i$ records a set of key positions that the $i$-th query vector attends to.\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\text{Attend}(\\\\mathbf{X}, \\\\mathcal{S}) &= \\\\Big( a(\\\\mathbf{x}_i, S_i) \\\\Big)_{i \\\\in \\\\{1, \\\\dots, L\\\\}} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{ where } a(\\\\mathbf{x}_i, S_i) &= \\\\text{softmax}\\\\Big(\\\\frac{(\\\\mathbf{x}_i \\\\mathbf{W}^q)(\\\\mathbf{x}_j \\\\mathbf{W}^k)_{j \\\\in S_i}^\\\\top}{\\\\sqrt{d_k}}\\\\Big) (\\\\mathbf{x}_j \\\\mathbf{W}^v)_{j \\\\in S_i}\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nNote that although the size of $S_i$ is not fixed, $a(\\\\mathbf{x}_i, S_i)$ is always of size $d_v$ and thus $\\\\text{Attend}(\\\\mathbf{X}, \\\\mathcal{S}) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{L \\\\times d_v}$.\\nIn auto-regressive models, one attention span is defined as $S_i = \\\\{j: j \\\\leq i\\\\}$ as it allows each token to attend to all the positions in the past.\\nIn factorized self-attention, the set $S_i$ is decomposed into a tree of dependencies, such that for every pair of $(i, j)$ where $j \\\\leq i$, there is a path connecting $i$ back to $j$ and $i$ can attend to $j$ either directly or indirectly.\\nPrecisely, the set $S_i$ is divided into $p$ non-overlapping subsets, where the $m$-th subset is denoted as $A^{(m)}_i \\\\subset S_i, m = 1,\\\\dots, p$. Therefore the path between the output position $i$ and any $j$ has a maximum length $p + 1$. For example, if $(j, a, b, c, \\\\dots, i)$ is a path of indices between $i$ and $j$, we would have $j \\\\in A_a^{(1)}, a \\\\in A_b^{(2)}, b \\\\in A_c^{(3)}, \\\\dots$, so on and so forth.\\nSparse Factorized Attention\\nSparse Transformer proposed two types of fractorized attention. It is easier to understand the concepts as illustrated in Fig. 10 with 2D image inputs as examples.\\n\\n\\nThe top row illustrates the attention connectivity patterns in (a) Transformer, (b) Sparse Transformer with strided attention, and (c) Sparse Transformer with fixed attention. The bottom row contains corresponding self-attention connectivity matrices. Note that the top and bottom rows are not in the same scale. (Image source: Child et al., 2019 + a few of extra annotations.)\\n\\n\\n\\nStrided attention with stride $\\\\ell \\\\sim \\\\sqrt{n}$. This works well with image data as the structure is aligned with strides. In the image case, each pixel would attend to all the previous $\\\\ell$ pixels in the raster scanning order (naturally cover the entire width of the image) and then those pixels attend to others in the same column (defined by another attention connectivity subset).\\n\\n $$\\n \\\\begin{aligned}\\n A_i^{(1)} &= \\\\{ t, t+1, \\\\dots, i\\\\} \\\\text{, where } t = \\\\max(0, i - \\\\ell) \\\\\\\\\\n A_i^{(2)} &= \\\\{j: (i-j) \\\\mod \\\\ell = 0\\\\}\\n \\\\end{aligned}\\n $$\\n \\n\\n\\nFixed attention. A small set of tokens summarize previous locations and propagate that information to all future locations.\\n\\n $$\\n \\\\begin{aligned}\\n A_i^{(1)} &= \\\\{j: \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{j}{\\\\ell} \\\\rfloor = \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{i}{\\\\ell} \\\\rfloor \\\\} \\\\\\\\\\n A_i^{(2)} &= \\\\{j: j \\\\mod \\\\ell \\\\in \\\\{\\\\ell-c, \\\\dots, \\\\ell-1\\\\} \\\\}\\n \\\\end{aligned}\\n $$\\n \\nwhere $c$ is a hyperparameter. If $c=1$, it restricts the representation whereas many depend on a few positions. The paper chose $c\\\\in \\\\{ 8, 16, 32 \\\\}$ for $\\\\ell \\\\in \\\\{ 128, 256 \\\\}$.\\n\\n\\nUse Factorized Self-Attention in Transformer\\nThere are three ways to use sparse factorized attention patterns in Transformer architecture:\\n\\nOne attention type per residual block and then interleave them, \\n$\\\\text{attn}(\\\\mathbf{X}) = \\\\text{Attend}(\\\\mathbf{X}, A^{(n \\\\mod p)}) \\\\mathbf{W}^o$, where $n$ is the index of the current residual block.\\nSet up a single head which attends to locations that all the factorized heads attend to, \\n$\\\\text{attn}(\\\\mathbf{X}) = \\\\text{Attend}(\\\\mathbf{X}, \\\\cup_{m=1}^p A^{(m)}) \\\\mathbf{W}^o $.\\nUse a multi-head attention mechanism, but different from vanilla Transformer, each head might adopt a pattern presented above, 1 or 2. $\\\\rightarrow$ This option often performs the best.\\n\\nSparse Transformer also proposed a set of changes so as to train the Transformer up to hundreds of layers, including gradient checkpointing, recomputing attention & FF layers during the backward pass, mixed precision training, efficient block-sparse implementation, etc. Please check the paper for more details or my previous post on techniques for scaling up model training.\\nBlockwise Attention (Qiu et al. 2019) introduces a sparse block matrix to only allow each token to attend to a small set of other tokens. Each attention matrix of size $L \\\\times L$ is partitioned into $n \\\\times n$ smaller blocks of size $\\\\frac{L}{n}\\\\times\\\\frac{L}{n}$ and a sparse block matrix $\\\\mathbf{M} \\\\in \\\\{0, 1\\\\}^{L \\\\times L}$ is defined by a permutation $\\\\pi$ of ${1, \\\\dots, n}$, which records the column index per row in the block matrix.\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\text{attn}(\\\\mathbf{Q}, \\\\mathbf{K}, \\\\mathbf{V}, \\\\mathbf{M}) &= \\\\text{softmax}\\\\Big(\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{Q}\\\\mathbf{K}^\\\\top}{\\\\sqrt{d}} \\\\odot \\\\mathbf{M}\\\\Big)\\\\mathbf{V} \\\\\\\\\\n(\\\\mathbf{A} \\\\odot \\\\mathbf{M})_{ij} &= \\\\begin{cases}\\nA_{ij} & \\\\text{if }M_{ij} = 1 \\\\\\\\\\n-\\\\infty & \\\\text{if }M_{ij} = 0 \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{cases} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{where } M_{ij} &= \\\\begin{cases}\\n1 & \\\\text{if }\\\\pi\\\\big(\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{(i-1)n}{L} + 1\\\\rfloor\\\\big) = \\\\lfloor\\\\frac{(j-1)n}{L} + 1\\\\rfloor \\\\\\\\\\n0 & \\\\text{otherwise}\\n\\\\end{cases}\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nThe actual implementation of Blockwise Attention only stores QKV as block matrices, each of size $n\\\\times n$:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\text{Blockwise-attn}(\\\\mathbf{Q}, \\\\mathbf{K}, \\\\mathbf{V}, \\\\mathbf{M}) = \\\\begin{bmatrix}\\n\\\\text{softmax}\\\\big(\\\\frac{\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{q}}_1\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{k}}_{\\\\pi(1)}^\\\\top}{\\\\sqrt{d}} \\\\Big)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{v}}_{\\\\pi(1)} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\text{softmax}\\\\big(\\\\frac{\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{q}}_n\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{k}}_{\\\\pi(n)}^\\\\top}{\\\\sqrt{d}} \\\\odot \\\\Big)\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{v}}_{\\\\pi(n)} \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\end{bmatrix}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{q}}_i$, $\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{k}}_i$ and $\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{v}}_i$ are the $i$-the row in the QKV block matrix respectively. Each $\\\\mathbf{q}_i\\\\mathbf{k}_{\\\\pi(i)}^\\\\top, \\\\forall i = 1, \\\\dots, n$ is of size $\\\\frac{N}{n}\\\\times\\\\frac{N}{n}$ and therefore Blockwise Attention is able to reduce the memory complexity of attention matrix from $\\\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ to $\\\\mathcal{O}(\\\\frac{L}{n}\\\\times\\\\frac{L}{n} \\\\times n) = \\\\mathcal{O}(L^2/n)$.\\nCombination of Local and Global Context#\\nETC (Extended Transformer Construction; Ainslie et al. 2019), Longformer (Beltagy et al. 2020) and Big Bird (Zaheer et al. 2020) models combine both local and global context when building an attention matrix. All these models can be initialized from existing pretrained models.\\nGlobal-Local Attention of ETC (Ainslie et al. 2019) takes two inputs, (1) the long input $\\\\mathbf{x}^l$ of size $n_l$ which is the regular input sequence and (2) the global input $\\\\mathbf{x}^g$ of size $n_g$ which contains a smaller number of auxiliary tokens, $n_g \\\\ll n_l$. Attention is thus split into four components based on directional attention across these two inputs: g2g, g2l, l2g and l2l. Because the l2l attention piece can be very large, it is restricted to a fixed size attention span of radius $w$ (i.e. local attention span) and the l2l matrix can be reshaped to $n_l \\\\times (2w+1)$.\\nETC utilizes four binary matrices to handle structured inputs, $\\\\mathbf{M}^{g2g}$, $\\\\mathbf{M}^{g2l}$, $\\\\mathbf{M}^{l2g}$ and $\\\\mathbf{M}^{l2l}$. For example, each element $z^g_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d$ in the attention output $z^g = (z^g_1, \\\\dots, z^g_{n_g})$ for g2g attention piece is formatted as:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\na^{g2g}_{ij} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{d}} x^g_i \\\\mathbf{W}^Q (x^g_j \\\\mathbf{W}^K + P^K_{ij})^\\\\top - (1- M^{g2g}_{ij})C \\\\\\\\\\nA^{g2g}_{ij} = \\\\frac{\\\\exp(a^{g2g}_{ij})}{\\\\sum_{k=1}^{n_g} \\\\exp(a^{g2g}_{ik})} \\\\quad\\nz^g_i = \\\\sum^{n_g}_{j=1} A^{g2g}_{ij} x^g_j \\\\mathbf{W}^V\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nwhere $P^K_{ij}$ is a learnable vector for relative position encoding and $C$ is a very large constant ($C=10000$ in the paper) to offset any attention weights when mask is off.\\n\\n\\nAttention patterns of ETC, Longformer and Big Bird.\\n\\nOne more update in ETC is to incorporate a CPC (contrastive predictive coding) task using NCE loss into the pretraining stage, besides the MLM task: The representation of one sentence should be similar to the representation of context around it when this sentence is masked.\\nThe global input $\\\\mathbf{x}^g$ for ETC is constructed as follows: Assuming there are some segments within the long inputs (e.g. by sentence), each segment is attached with one auxiliary token to learn global inputs. Relative position encoding is used to mark the global segment tokens with the token position. Hard masking in one direction (i.e., tokens before vs after are labeled differently) is found to bring performance gains in some datasets.\\nAttention pattern in Longformer contains three components:\\n\\nLocal attention: Similar to ETC, local attention is controlled by a sliding window of fixed size $w$;\\nGlobal attention of preselected tokens: Longformer has a few pre-selected tokens (e.g. [CLS] token) assigned with global attention span, that is, attending to all other tokens in the input sequence.\\nDilated attention: Dilated sliding window of fixed size $r$ and gaps of dilation size $d$, similar to Sparse Transformer;\\n\\nBig Bird is quite similar to Longformer, equipped with both local attention and a few preselected tokens with global attention span, but Big Bird replaces dilated attention with a new mechanism where all tokens attend to a set of random tokens. The design is motivated by the fact that attention pattern can be viewed as a directed graph and a random graph has the property that information is able to rapidly flow between any pair of nodes.\\nLongformer uses smaller window size at lower layers and larger window sizes at higher layers. Ablation studies showed that this setup works better than reversed or fixed size config. Lower layers do not have dilated sliding windows to better learn to use immediate local context. Longformer also has a staged training procedure where initially the model is trained with small window size to learn from local context and then subsequent stages of training have window sizes increased and learning rate decreased.\\nContent-based Attention#\\nThe improvements proposed by Reformer (Kitaev, et al. 2020) aim to solve the following pain points in vanilla Transformer:\\n\\nQuadratic time and memory complexity within self-attention module.\\nMemory in a model with $N$ layers is $N$-times larger than in a single-layer model because we need to store activations for back-propagation.\\nThe intermediate FF layers are often quite large.\\n\\nReformer proposed two main changes:\\n\\nReplace the dot-product attention with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) attention, reducing the complexity from $\\\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ to $\\\\mathcal{O}(L\\\\log L)$.\\nReplace the standard residual blocks with reversible residual layers, which allows storing activations only once during training instead of $N$ times (i.e. proportional to the number of layers).\\n\\nLocality-Sensitive Hashing Attention\\nIn $\\\\mathbf{Q} \\\\mathbf{K}^\\\\top$ part of the attention formula, we are only interested in the largest elements as only large elements contribute a lot after softmax. For each query $\\\\mathbf{q}_i \\\\in \\\\mathbf{Q}$, we are looking for row vectors in $\\\\mathbf{K}$ closest to $\\\\mathbf{q}_i$. In order to find nearest neighbors quickly in high-dimensional space, Reformer incorporates Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) into its attention mechanism.\\nA hashing scheme $x \\\\mapsto h(x)$ is locality-sensitive if it preserves the distancing information between data points, such that close vectors obtain similar hashes while distant vectors have very different ones. The Reformer adopts a hashing scheme as such, given a fixed random matrix $\\\\mathbf{R} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{d \\\\times b/2}$ (where $b$ is a hyperparam), the hash function is $h(x) = \\\\arg\\\\max([xR; −xR])$.\\n\\n\\n\\nIllustration of Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) attention. (Image source: right part of Figure 1 in Kitaev, et al. 2020).\\n\\nIn LSH attention, a query can only attend to positions in the same hashing bucket, $S_i = \\\\{j: h(\\\\mathbf{q}_i) = h(\\\\mathbf{k}_j)\\\\}$. It is carried out in the following process, as illustrated in Fig. 20:\\n\\n(a) The attention matrix for full attention is often sparse.\\n(b) Using LSH, we can sort the keys and queries to be aligned according to their hash buckets.\\n(c) Set $\\\\mathbf{Q} = \\\\mathbf{K}$ (precisely $\\\\mathbf{k}_j = \\\\mathbf{q}_j / |\\\\mathbf{q}_j|$), so that there are equal numbers of keys and queries in one bucket, easier for batching. Interestingly, this “shared-QK” config does not affect the performance of the Transformer.\\n(d) Apply batching where chunks of $m$ consecutive queries are grouped together.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe LSH attention consists of 4 steps: bucketing, sorting, chunking, and attention computation. (Image source: left part of Figure 1 in Kitaev, et al. 2020).\\n\\nReversible Residual Network\\nAnother improvement by Reformer is to use reversible residual layers (Gomez et al. 2017). The motivation for reversible residual network is to design the architecture in a way that activations at any given layer can be recovered from the activations at the following layer, using only the model parameters. Hence, we can save memory by recomputing the activation during backprop rather than storing all the activations.\\nGiven a layer $x \\\\mapsto y$, the normal residual layer does $y = x + F(x)$, but the reversible layer splits both input and output into pairs $(x_1, x_2) \\\\mapsto (y_1, y_2)$ and then executes the following:\\n\\n$$\\ny_1 = x_1 + F(x_2),\\\\; y_2 = x_2 + G(y_1) \\n$$\\n\\nand reversing is easy:\\n\\n$$\\nx_2 = y_2 - G(y_1), \\\\; x_1 = y_1 − F(x_2)\\n$$\\n\\nReformer applies the same idea to Transformer by combination attention ($F$) and feed-forward layers ($G$) within a reversible net block:\\n\\n$$\\nY_1 = X_1 + \\\\text{Attention}(X_2), \\\\; Y_2 = X_2 + \\\\text{FeedForward}(Y_1)\\n$$\\n\\nThe memory can be further reduced by chunking the feed-forward computation:\\n\\n$$\\nY_2 = [Y_2^{(1)}; \\\\dots; Y_2^{(c)}] = [X_2^{(1)} + \\\\text{FeedForward}(Y_1^{(1)}); \\\\dots; X_2^{(c)} + \\\\text{FeedForward}(Y_1^{(c)})]\\n$$\\n\\nThe resulting reversible Transformer does not need to store activation in every layer.\\nRouting Transformer (Roy et al. 2021) is also built on content-based clustering of keys and queries. Instead of using a static hashing function like LSH, it utilizes online $k$-means clustering and combines it with local, temporal sparse attention to reduce the attention complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L^{1.5})$.\\nWithin routing attention, both keys and queries are clustered with $k$-means clustering method and the same set of centroids $\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\mu} = (\\\\mu_1, \\\\dots, \\\\mu_k) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{k \\\\times d}$. Queries are routed to keys that get assigned to the same centroid. The total complexity is $O(Lkd + L^2d/k)$, where $O(Lkd)$ is for running clustering assignments and $O(L^2d/k)$ is for attention computation. The cluster centroids are updated by EMA (exponential moving average) using all associated keys and queries.\\nIn the experiments for Routing Transformer, some best config only has routing attention enabled in the last two layers of the model and half of the attention heads, while the other half utilizing local attention. They also observed that local attention is a pretty strong baseline and larger attention window always leads to better results.\\nLow-Rank Attention#\\nLinformer (Wang et al. 2020) approximates the full attention matrix with a low rank matrix, reducing the time & space complexity to be linear. Instead of using expensive SVD to identify low rank decomposition, Linformer adds two linear projections $\\\\mathbf{E}_i, \\\\mathbf{F}_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{L \\\\times k}$ for key and value matrices, respectively, reducing their dimensions from $L \\\\times d$ to $k \\\\times d$. As long as $k \\\\ll L$, the attention memory can be greatly reduced.\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\overline{\\\\text{head}}_i \\n&= \\\\text{attn}(\\\\mathbf{X}_q\\\\mathbf{W}^q_i, \\\\mathbf{E}_i\\\\mathbf{X}_k\\\\mathbf{W}^k_i, \\\\mathbf{F}_i\\\\mathbf{X}_v\\\\mathbf{W}^v_i) \\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\underbrace{\\\\text{softmax}\\\\Big( \\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{X}_q\\\\mathbf{W}^q_i (\\\\mathbf{E}_i \\\\mathbf{X}_k\\\\mathbf{W}^k_i)^\\\\top}{\\\\sqrt{d}} \\\\Big)}_{\\\\text{low rank attention matrix }\\\\bar{A} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{k \\\\times d}} \\\\mathbf{F}_i \\\\mathbf{X}_v\\\\mathbf{W}^v_i\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nAdditional techniques can be applied to further improve efficiency of Linformer:\\n\\nParameter sharing between projection layers, such as head-wise, key-value  and layer-wise (across all layers) sharing.\\nUse different $k$ at different layers, as heads in higher layers tend to have a more skewed distribution (lower rank) and thus we can use smaller $k$ at higher layers.\\nUse different types of projections; e.g. mean/max pooling, convolution layer with kernel and stride $L/k$.\\n\\n\\n\\n(Left) Informer has two projection layers added for keys and values. (Right) Plot of inference time as a function of sequence length. (Image source: Wang et al. 2020).\\n\\nRandom Feature Attention (RFA; Peng et al. 2021) relies on random feature methods (Rahimi & Recht, 2007) to approximate softmax operation in self-attention with low rank feature maps in order to achieve linear time and space complexity. Performers (Choromanski et al. 2021) also adopts random feature attention with improvements on the kernel construction to further reduce the kernel approximation error.\\nThe main theorem behind RFA is from Rahimi & Recht, 2007:\\n\\nLet $\\\\phi: \\\\mathbb{R}^d \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}^{2D}$ be a nonlinear transformation:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{D}}[\\\\sin(\\\\mathbf{w}_1^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{x}), \\\\dots, \\\\sin(\\\\mathbf{w}_D^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{x}), \\\\cos(\\\\mathbf{w}_1^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{x}), \\\\dots, \\\\cos(\\\\mathbf{w}_D^\\\\top \\\\mathbf{x})]^\\\\top\\n$$\\n\\nWhen $d$-dimensional random vectors $\\\\mathbf{w}_i$ are i.i.d. from $\\\\mathcal{N}(\\\\mathbf{0}, \\\\sigma^2\\\\mathbf{I}_d)$,\\n$$\\n\\\\mathbb{E}_{\\\\mathbf{w}_i} [\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x}) \\\\cdot \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{y})] = \\\\exp(-\\\\frac{\\\\| \\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{y} \\\\|^2}{2\\\\sigma^2})\\n$$\\n\\nAn unbiased estimation of $\\\\exp(\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{y})$ is:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\exp(\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{y} / \\\\sigma^2) \\n&= \\\\exp(\\\\frac{1}{2\\\\sigma^2}(\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\|^2 + \\\\|\\\\mathbf{y}\\\\|^2 - \\\\|\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{y}\\\\|^2) \\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\|^2}{2\\\\sigma^2}) \\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\|\\\\mathbf{y}\\\\|^2}{2\\\\sigma^2}) ( - \\\\frac{\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x} - \\\\mathbf{y}\\\\|^2}{2\\\\sigma^2}) \\\\\\\\\\n&\\\\approx \\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\|\\\\mathbf{x}\\\\|^2}{2\\\\sigma^2}) \\\\exp(\\\\frac{\\\\|\\\\mathbf{y}\\\\|^2}{2\\\\sigma^2})\\\\;\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\cdot\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{y}) \\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\exp(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sigma^2})\\\\;\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\cdot\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{y}) & \\\\text{; unit vectors}\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nThen we can write the attention function as follows, where $\\\\otimes$ is outer product operation and $\\\\sigma^2$ is the temperature:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\text{attn}(\\\\mathbf{q}_t, \\\\{\\\\mathbf{k}_i\\\\}, \\\\{\\\\mathbf{v}_i\\\\}) \\n&= \\\\sum_i \\\\frac{\\\\exp(\\\\mathbf{q}_t\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{k}_i/\\\\sigma^2)}{\\\\sum_j \\\\exp(\\\\mathbf{q}_t\\\\cdot\\\\mathbf{k}_j/\\\\sigma^2)}\\\\mathbf{v}_i^\\\\top\\n\\\\approx \\\\sum_i \\\\frac{\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{q}_t)\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{k}_i)\\\\mathbf{v}_i^\\\\top}{\\\\sum_j \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{q}_t)\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{k}_j)} \\\\\\\\\\n&= \\\\color{green}{\\\\frac{\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{q}_t)^\\\\top \\\\sum_i \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{k}_i)\\\\otimes\\\\mathbf{v}_i}{\\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{q}_t)^\\\\top \\\\sum_j \\\\phi(\\\\mathbf{k}_j)}\\n= \\\\text{RFA}(\\\\mathbf{q}_t, \\\\{\\\\mathbf{k}_i\\\\}, \\\\{\\\\mathbf{v}_i\\\\})}\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\n\\n\\n(Left) The order of computation for default softmax operation.

(Image source: Choromanski et al. 2021).\\n\\nTransformers for Reinforcement Learning#\\nThe self-attention mechanism avoids compressing the whole past into a fixed-size hidden state and does not suffer from vanishing or exploding gradients as much as RNNs. Reinforcement Learning tasks can for sure benefit from these traits. However, it is quite difficult to train Transformer even in supervised learning, let alone in the RL context. It could be quite challenging to stabilize and train a LSTM agent by itself, after all.\\nThe Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL; Parisotto, et al. 2019) is one attempt to use Transformer for RL. GTrXL succeeded in stabilizing training with two changes on top of Transformer-XL:\\n\\nThe layer normalization is only applied on the input stream in a residual module, but NOT on the shortcut stream. A key benefit to this reordering is to allow the original input to flow from the first to last layer.\\nThe residual connection is replaced with a GRU-style (Gated Recurrent Unit; Chung et al., 2014) gating mechanism.\\n\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\nr &= \\\\sigma(W_r^{(l)} y + U_r^{(l)} x) \\\\\\\\\\nz &= \\\\sigma(W_z^{(l)} y + U_z^{(l)} x - b_g^{(l)}) \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\hat{h} &= \\\\tanh(W_g^{(l)} y + U_g^{(l)} (r \\\\odot x)) \\\\\\\\\\ng^{(l)}(x, y) &= (1-z)\\\\odot x + z\\\\odot \\\\hat{h}\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$\\n\\nThe gating function parameters are explicitly initialized to be close to an identity map - this is why there is a $b_g$ term. A $b_g > 0$ greatly helps with the learning speedup.\\n\\n\\nComparison of the model architecture of Transformer-XL, Transformer-XL with the layer norm reordered, and Gated Transformer-XL. (Image source: Figure 1 in Parisotto, et al. 2019)\\n\\nDecision Transformer (DT; Chen et al 2021) formulates Reinforcement Learning problems as a process of conditional sequence modeling, outputting the optimal actions conditioned on the desired return, past states and actions. It therefore becomes straightforward to use Transformer architecture. Decision Transformer is for off-policy RL, where the model only has access to a fixed collection of trajectories collected by other policies.\\nTo encourage the model to learn how to act in order to achieve a desired return, it feeds the model with desired future return $\\\\hat{R} = \\\\sum_{t’=t}^T r_{t’}$ instead of the current reward. The trajectory consists of a list of triplets, (return-to-go $\\\\hat{R}_t, state $s_t$, action $a_t$), and it is used as an input sequence for Transformer:\\n\\n$$\\n\\\\tau = (\\\\hat{R}_1, s_1, a_1, \\\\hat{R}_2, s_2, a_2, \\\\dots, \\\\hat{R}_T, s_T, a_T)\\n$$\\n\\nThree linear layers are added and trained for return-to-go, state and action respectively to extract token embeddings. The prediction head learns to predict $a_t$ corresponding to the input token $s_t$. The training uses cross-entropy loss for discrete actions or MSE for continuous actions.

An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\n\\nExamples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\n\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equip agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\n\\nExperiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\n\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\n\\nAfter fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\n\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\n\\nComparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\n\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCategorization of human memory.\\n\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\n\\nComparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\n\\nA picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\n\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\n\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\n\\nPseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\n\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\n\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

It is an empirical science and the effect of prompt engineering methods can vary a lot among models, thus requiring heavy experimentation and heuristics.\\nThis post only focuses on prompt engineering for autoregressive language models, so nothing with Cloze tests, image generation or multimodality models. At its core, the goal of prompt engineering is about alignment and model steerability. Check my previous post on controllable text generation.\\n[My personal spicy take] In my opinion, some prompt engineering papers are not worthy 8 pages long, since those tricks can be explained in one or a few sentences and the rest is all about benchmarking. An easy-to-use and shared benchmark infrastructure should be more beneficial to the community. Iterative prompting or external tool use would not be trivial to set up. Also non-trivial to align the whole research community to adopt it.\\nBasic Prompting#\\nZero-shot and few-shot learning are two most basic approaches for prompting the model, pioneered by many LLM papers and commonly used for benchmarking LLM performance.\\nZero-Shot#\\nZero-shot learning is to simply feed the task text to the model and ask for results.\\n(All the sentiment analysis examples are from SST-2)\\nText: i\\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\\nSentiment:\\nFew-shot#\\nFew-shot learning presents a set of high-quality demonstrations, each consisting of both input and desired output, on the target task. As the model first sees good examples, it can better understand human intention and criteria for what kinds of answers are wanted. Therefore, few-shot learning often leads to better performance than zero-shot. However, it comes at the cost of more token consumption and may hit the context length limit when input and output text are long.\\nText: (lawrence bounces) all over the stage, dancing, running, sweating, mopping his face and generally displaying the wacky talent that brought him fame in the first place.\\nSentiment: positive\\n\\nText: despite all evidence to the contrary, this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie, the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on tv and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults.\\nSentiment: negative\\n\\nText: for the first time in years, de niro digs deep emotionally, perhaps because he\\'s been stirred by the powerful work of his co-stars.\\nSentiment: positive\\n\\nText: i\\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\\nSentiment:\\nMany studies looked into how to construct in-context examples to maximize the performance and observed that choice of prompt format, training examples, and the order of the examples can lead to dramatically different performance, from near random guess to near SoTA.\\nZhao et al. (2021) investigated the case of few-shot classification and proposed that several biases with LLM (they use GPT-3 in the experiments) contribute to such high variance: (1) Majority label bias exists if distribution of labels among the examples is unbalanced; (2) Recency bias refers to the tendency where the model may repeat the label at the end; (3) Common token bias indicates that LLM tends to produce common tokens more often than rare tokens. To conquer such bias, they proposed a method to calibrate the label probabilities output by the model to be uniform when the input string is N/A.\\nTips for Example Selection#\\n\\n\\nChoose examples that are semantically similar to the test example using $k$-NN clustering in the embedding space (Liu et al., 2021)\\n\\n\\nTo select a diverse and representative set of examples, Su et al. (2022) proposed to use a graph-based approach: (1) First, construct a directed graph $G=(V, E)$ based on the embedding (e.g. by SBERT or other embedding models) cosine similarity between samples, where each node points to its $k$ nearest neighbors; (2) Start with a set of selected samples $\\\\mathcal{L}=\\\\emptyset$ and a set of remaining samples $\\\\mathcal{U}$. Each sample $u \\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}$ is scored by $$\\n\\\\text{score}(u) = \\\\sum_{v \\\\in \\\\{v \\\\mid (u, v) \\\\in E, v\\\\in \\\\mathcal{U}\\\\}} s(v)\\\\quad\\\\text{where }s(v)=\\\\rho^{- \\\\vert \\\\{\\\\ell \\\\in \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\vert (v, \\\\ell)\\\\in E \\\\}\\\\vert},\\\\quad\\\\rho > 1\\n$$ such that $s(v)$ is low if many of $v$’s neighbors are selected and thus the scoring encourages to pick diverse samples.\\n\\n\\nRubin et al. (2022) proposed to train embeddings via contrastive learning specific to one training dataset for in-context learning sample selection.  Given each training pair $(x, y)$, the quality of one example $e_i$ (formatted input-output pair) can be measured by a conditioned probability assigned by LM: $\\\\text{score}(e_i) = P_\\\\text{LM}(y \\\\mid e_i, x)$. We can identify other examples with top-$k$ and bottom-$k$ scores as positive and negative sets of candidates for every training pair and use that for contrastive learning.\\n\\n\\nSome researchers tried Q-Learning to do sample selection. (Zhang et al. 2022)\\n\\n\\nMotivated by uncertainty-based active learning, Diao et al. (2023) suggested to identify examples with high disagreement or entropy among multiple sampling trials. Then annotate these examples to be used in few-shot prompts.\\n\\n\\nTips for Example Ordering#\\n\\nA general suggestion is to keep the selection of examples diverse, relevant to the test sample and in random order to avoid majority label bias and recency bias.\\nIncreasing model sizes or including more training examples does not reduce variance among different permutations of in-context examples. Same order may work well for one model but badly for another. When the validation set is limited, consider choosing the order such that the model does not produce extremely unbalanced predictions or being overconfident about its predictions. (Lu et al. 2022)\\n\\nInstruction Prompting#\\nThe purpose of presenting few-shot examples in the prompt is to explain our intent to the model; in other words, describe the task instruction to the model in the form of demonstrations. However, few-shot can be expensive in terms of token usage and restricts the input length due to limited context length. So, why not just give the instruction directly?\\nInstructed LM (e.g. InstructGPT, natural instruction) finetunes a pretrained model with high-quality tuples of (task instruction, input, ground truth output) to make LM better understand user intention and follow instruction. RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) is a common method to do so. The benefit of instruction following style fine-tuning improves the model to be more aligned with human intention and greatly reduces the cost of communication.\\nWhen interacting with instruction models, we should describe the task requirement in details, trying to be specific and precise and avoiding say “not do something” but rather specify what to do.\\nPlease label the sentiment towards the movie of the given movie review. The sentiment label should be \"positive\" or \"negative\". \\nText: i\\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film. \\nSentiment:\\nExplaining the desired audience is another smart way to give instructions\\n\\nFor example to produce education materials for kids,\\n\\nDescribe what is quantum physics to a 6-year-old.\\n\\nAnd safe content,\\n\\n... in language that is safe for work.\\nIn-context instruction learning (Ye et al. 2023) combines few-shot learning with instruction prompting. It incorporates multiple demonstration examples across different tasks in the prompt, each demonstration consisting of instruction, task input and output. Note that their experiments were only on classification tasks and the instruction prompt contains all label options.\\nDefinition: Determine the speaker of the dialogue, \"agent\" or \"customer\".\\nInput: I have successfully booked your tickets.\\nOuput: agent\\n\\nDefinition: Determine which category the question asks for, \"Quantity\" or \"Location\".\\nInput: What\\'s the oldest building in US?\\nOuput: Location\\n\\nDefinition: Classify the sentiment of the given movie review, \"positive\" or \"negative\".\\nInput: i\\'ll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\\nOutput:\\nSelf-Consistency Sampling#\\nSelf-consistency sampling (Wang et al. 2022a) is to sample multiple outputs with temperature > 0 and then selecting the best one out of these candidates.\\nThe criteria for selecting the best candidate can vary from task to task. A general solution is to pick majority vote. For tasks that are easy to validate such as a programming question with unit tests, we can simply run through the interpreter and verify the correctness with unit tests.\\nChain-of-Thought (CoT)#\\nChain-of-thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al. 2022) generates a sequence of short sentences to describe reasoning logics step by step, known as reasoning chains or rationales, to eventually lead to the final answer. The benefit of CoT is more pronounced for complicated reasoning tasks, while using large models (e.g. with more than 50B parameters). Simple tasks only benefit slightly from CoT prompting.\\nTypes of CoT prompts#\\nTwo main types of CoT prompting:\\n\\nFew-shot CoT. It is to prompt the model with a few demonstrations, each containing manually written (or model-generated) high-quality reasoning chains.\\n\\n(All the math reasoning examples are from GSM8k)\\nQuestion: Tom and Elizabeth have a competition to climb a hill. Elizabeth takes 30 minutes to climb the hill. Tom takes four times as long as Elizabeth does to climb the hill. How many hours does it take Tom to climb up the hill?\\nAnswer: It takes Tom 30*4 = <<30*4=120>>120 minutes to climb the hill.\\nIt takes Tom 120/60 = <<120/60=2>>2 hours to climb the hill.\\nSo the answer is 2.\\n===\\nQuestion: Jack is a soccer player. He needs to buy two pairs of socks and a pair of soccer shoes. Each pair of socks cost $9.50, and the shoes cost $92. Jack has $40. How much more money does Jack need?\\nAnswer: The total cost of two pairs of socks is $9.50 x 2 = $<<9.5*2=19>>19.\\nThe total cost of the socks and the shoes is $19 + $92 = $<<19+92=111>>111.\\nJack need $111 - $40 = $<<111-40=71>>71 more.\\nSo the answer is 71.\\n===\\nQuestion: Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?\\nAnswer:\\n\\nZero-shot CoT. Use natural language statement like Let\\'s think step by step to explicitly encourage the model to first generate reasoning chains and then to prompt with Therefore, the answer is to produce answers (Kojima et al. 2022 ). Or a similar statement Let\\'s work this out it a step by step to be sure we have the right answer (Zhou et al. 2022).\\n\\nQuestion: Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon that he must cut into 4 equal parts. Each of the cut parts must be divided into 5 equal parts. How long will each final cut be?\\nAnswer: Let\\'s think step by step.\\nTips and Extensions#\\n\\n\\nSelf-consistency sampling can improve reasoning accuracy by sampling a number of diverse answers and then taking the majority vote. (Wang et al. 2022a)\\n\\n\\nAnother approach for ensemble learning is to alter the example order or use model generated rationales to replace human-written ones to introduce randomness during multiple sample trials. Then aggregate model outputs with a majority vote to get final answer. (Wang et al. 2022b)\\n\\n\\nIf training examples are only associated with true answers (easy to verify!) but no rationales, we can follow the STaR (Self-Taught Reasoner; Zelikman et al. 2022) method : (1) Ask LLM to generate reasoning chains and only keep those leading to correct answers; (2) Then fine-tune the model with generated rationales and repeat the process until convergence. Note that higher temperature is more likely to generate incorrect rationales with correct answers. If training examples do not have ground truth answers, maybe consider using majority votes as the “correct” answers.\\n\\n\\nPrompts with demonstrations of higher reasoning complexity can achieve better performance, where complexity is measured by the number of reasoning steps in the chains. When separating reasoning steps, newline \\\\n symbol works better than step i, period . or semicolon ;. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nComplexity-based consistency is to explicitly prefer complex chains among all the generations by taking majority vote among only top $k$ complex chains. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nLater, Shum et al. (2023) found that in their experiments CoT prompts with only complex examples can improve the accuracy of complex questions, but perform poorly in simple questions; evidence shown on GSM8k.\\n\\n\\nChanging Q: to Question: is found to be helpful. (Fu et al. 2023)\\n\\n\\nYe & Durrett (2022) found that the benefit of including explanations in the prompt is small to moderate for NLP tasks that involve reasoning over text (i.e. QA and NLI) and the effects vary by models. They observed that explanations are more likely to be nonfactual than be inconsistent (i.e. whether explanation entails prediction). Nonfactual explanations most likely lead to incorrect predictions.\\n\\n\\nSelf-Ask (Press et al. 2022) is a method to repeatedly prompt the model to ask following-up questions to construct the thought process iteratively. Follow-up questions can be answered by search engine results. Similarly, IRCoT (Interleaving Retrieval CoT; Trivedi et al. 2022) and ReAct (Reason + Act; Yao et al. 2023) combines iterative CoT prompting with queries to Wikipedia APIs to search for relevant entities and content and then add it back into the context.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Self-Ask works with external search queries.(Image source: Press et al. 2022).\\n\\n\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, essentially creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS or DFS while each state is evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\n\\n\\n\\nHow Self-Ask works with external search queries.(Image source: Yao et al. 2022).\\n\\nAutomatic Prompt Design#\\nPrompt is a sequence of prefix tokens that increase the probability of getting  desired output given input. Therefore we can treat them as trainable parameters and optimize them directly on the embedding space via gradient descent, such as AutoPrompt (Shin et al., 2020, Prefix-Tuning (Li & Liang (2021)), P-tuning (Liu et al. 2021) and Prompt-Tuning (Lester et al. 2021). This section in my “Controllable Neural Text Generation” post has a good coverage of them. The trend from AutoPrompt to Prompt-Tuning is that the setup gets gradually simplified.\\nAPE (Automatic Prompt Engineer; Zhou et al. 2022) is a method to search over a pool of model-generated instruction candidates and then filters the candidate set according to a chosen score function to ultimately choose the best candidate with highest score.\\n\\n\\nPrompt LLM to generate instruction candidates based on a small set of demonstrations in the form of input-output pairs. E.g. {{Given desired input-output pairs}}\\\\n\\\\nThe instruction is.\\n\\n\\nGiven a dataset of $\\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{train} = \\\\{(x, y)\\\\}$, we would like to find an instruction $\\\\rho$ such that $\\\\rho^* = \\\\arg\\\\max_\\\\rho \\\\mathbb{E}_{(x, y) \\\\in \\\\mathcal{D}_\\\\text{train}} [f(\\\\rho, x, y)]$, where $f(.)$ is a per-sample score function, such as execution accuracy $\\\\mathbb{1}[\\\\text{LM}(.\\\\vert \\\\rho, x)=y]$ or log probability: $p_\\\\text{LM}(y \\\\mid \\\\rho, x)$.\\n\\n\\nUse an iterative Monte Carlo search method to improve the best candidates by proposing semantically similar variants via prompts like Generate a variation of the following instruction while keeping the semantic meaning.\\\\n\\\\nInput: ...\\\\n\\\\nOutput:...\\n\\n\\nTo construct chain-of-thought prompts automatically, Shum et al. (2023) suggested augment-prune-select, a three-step process:\\n\\nAugment: Generate multiple pseudo-chains of thought given question using few-shot or zero-shot CoT prompts;\\nPrune: Prune pseudo chains based on whether generated answers match ground truths.\\nSelect: Apply a variance-reduced policy gradient strategy to learn the probability distribution over selected examples, while considering the probability distribution over examples as policy and the validation set accuracy as reward.\\n\\nZhang et al. (2023) instead adopted clustering techniques to sample questions and then generates chains. They observed that LLMs tend to make certain types of mistakes. One type of errors can be similar in the emebedding space and thus get grouped together. By only sampling one or a few from frequent-error clusters, we can prevent too many wrong demonstrations of one error type and collect a diverse set of examples.\\n\\nQuestion clustering: Embed questions and run $k$-means for clustering.\\nDemonstration selection: Select a set of representative questions from each cluster; i.e. one demonstration from one cluster. Samples in each cluster are sorted by distance to the cluster centroid and those closer to the centroid are selected first.\\nRationale generation: Use zero-shot CoT to generate reasoning chains for selected questions and construct few-shot prompt to run inference.\\n\\nAugmented Language Models#\\nA survey on augmented language models by Mialon et al. (2023) has great coverage over multiple categories of language models augmented with reasoning skills and the ability of using external tools. Recommend it.\\nRetrieval#\\nOften we need to complete tasks that require latest knowledge after the model pretraining time cutoff or internal/private knowledge base. In that case, the model would not know the context if we don’t explicitly provide it in the prompt. Many methods for Open Domain Question Answering depend on first doing retrieval over a knowledge base and then incorporating the retrieved content as part of the prompt. The accuracy of such a process depends on the quality of both retrieval and generation steps.\\nLazaridou et al. (2022) studied how to use Google Search for document retrieval to augment LLMs. Given a question $q$, clean text is extracted out of 20 URLs returned by Google, resulting in a set of documents. Because these documents are long, each document is split into paragraphs of 6 sentences, $\\\\{p\\\\}$. Paragraphs are ranked by TF-IDF based cosine similarity between evidence paragraphs and the query. Only the most relevant paragraph is used in the prompt to produce an answer $a$.\\nFor closed-book QA, each demonstration is formatted as follows to construct few-shot prompts. Swapping the question with the evidence (longer distance between questions and answers) is found to consistently yield lower results across all datasets.\\nEvidence: ...\\nQuestion: ...\\nAnswer: ...\\nThe answer probability is computed in three ways:\\n\\nRAG style, $p(a_i \\\\mid q) = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n p_\\\\text{tf-idf} (p_i \\\\mid q) \\\\cdot p_\\\\text{LM}(a_i \\\\mid q, p_i)$, where $p_\\\\text{tf-idf} (p_i \\\\mid q)$ is the normalized cosine similarities between the TF-IDF passage and question representations.\\nNoisy channel inference, $p(a_i\\\\mid q) = \\\\frac{p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid a_i, p_i) \\\\cdot p_\\\\text{LM}(a_i \\\\mid p_i)}{p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i)}$\\nProduct-of-Experts (PoE), combines all probabilities used above in addition to $p_\\\\text{LM}(p_i \\\\mid q)$.\\n\\nAccording to their experiments on generation and classification tasks, among three answer reranking scores - PoE > Noisy channel > RAG. Among individual probabilities, $p_\\\\text{LM}(a \\\\mid q, p_i)$ and $p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i, a)$ are found to be most informative. $p_\\\\text{LM}(q \\\\mid p_i, a)$ captures how well the question can be explained by LM given evidence paragraph and answer and can reliably be used for reranking answer candidates.\\nOne observation with SituatedQA dataset for questions grounded in different dates is that despite LM (pretraining cutoff is year 2020) has access to latest information via Google Search, its performance on post-2020 questions are still a lot worse than on pre-2020 questions. This suggests the existence of some discrepencies or conflicting parametric between contextual information and model internal knowledge.\\nInterestingly it is found to be beneficial even with only “internal retrieval”, that is, to generate knowledge about a topic before answering the question (Liu et al. 2022). First we can use  the following template to extract knowledge:\\nGenerate some knowledge about the input. Examples:\\n\\nInput: What type of water formation is formed by clouds?\\nKnowledge: Clouds are made of water vapor.\\n\\nInput: {question}\\nKnowledge:\\nAnd then with model-generated knowledge, prompt the LM further to get the answer.\\nProgramming Language#\\nBoth PAL (Program-aided language models); Gao et al. 2022) and PoT (Program of Thoughts prompting; Chen et al. 2022) ask LLM to generate programming language statements to resolve natural language reasoning problems, hence offloading the solution step to a runtime such as a Python interpreter. Such setup decouples complex computation and reasoning. It relies on a LM with good enough coding skills.\\n\\n\\nComparing CoT and PoT. (Image source: Chen et al. 2022).\\n\\nExternal APIs#\\nTALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) is a language model augmented with text-to-text API calls. LM is guided to generate |tool-call and tool input text conditioned on task input text to construct API call requests. When |result shows up, the specified tool API is called and the returned result gets appended to the text sequence. The final output is generated following |output token.\\n\\n\\nThe format of API calls in TALM. (Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).\\n\\nTALM adopts a self-play approach to iteratively bootstrap the dataset of tool use examples and finetune LM with it. This self-play, defined as a model interacting with a tool API, iteratively expands the dataset based on whether a newly added tool API can improve the model outputs. Same idea is adopted in Toolformer too, described in more details below. The pipeline loosely mimics a RL process where LM is the policy network and it is trained by policy gradient with a binary reward signal.\\n\\n\\nSelf-play iterations help boost the model performance.(Image source: Parisi et al. 2022).\\n\\nToolformer (Schick et al. 2023) is a LM that can use external tools via simple APIs, which is built in a self-supervised manner and only requires a handful of demonstrations for each API. The toolbox of Toolformer includes:\\n\\nCalculator to help LM with the lack of precise math skills;\\nQ&A system to help with unfaithful content and hallucination;\\nSearch engine to provide up-to-date information after pretraining cut off time;\\nTranslation system to improve performance on low resource language;\\nCalendar to make LM be aware of time progression.\\n\\n\\n\\nIllustration of how to build Toolformer.(Image source: Schick et al. 2023).\\n\\nToolformer is trained as follows:\\n\\n\\nPrompting to annotate potential API calls. Ask a pre-trained LM to annotate a dataset via few-shot learning with API call usage examples. Formatting example:\\n\\n\\nHow dataset is annotated to do API calls.(Image source: Schick et al. 2023).\\n\\n\\n\\n- Each API call is represented as a tuple of (API name, corresponding input), $c=(a_c, i_c)$ and its corresponding result is denoted as $r$. The API call sequences with and without results are labeled as follows, respectively:\\n\\n    <div>\\n    $$\\n    \\\\begin{aligned}\\n    e(c) &= \\\\langle\\\\texttt{API}\\\\rangle a_c(i_c) \\\\langle\\\\texttt{/API}\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\n    e(c, r) &= \\\\langle\\\\texttt{API}\\\\rangle a_c(i_c) \\\\to r \\\\langle\\\\texttt{/API}\\\\rangle\\n    \\\\end{aligned}\\n    $$\\n    </div>\\n\\n- Sample API calls based on the probabilities $p_\\\\text{LM}(\\\\langle\\\\texttt{API}\\\\rangle \\\\mid \\\\text{prompt}(\\\\mathbf{x}), \\\\mathbf{x}_{1:i})$ and select top $k$ candidate positions for doing API calls at position $i$ if the probability is larger than a threshold.\\n\\n- Then we sample potential API calls from the LM given the sequence $[\\\\text{prompt}(\\\\mathbf{x}), x_1, \\\\dots, x_{i-1}, \\\\langle\\\\texttt{API}\\\\rangle]$ as prefix and $\\\\langle\\\\texttt{/API}\\\\rangle$ as suffix.\\n\\n\\n\\nFilter annotations based on whether API calls help model predict future tokens. Use a self-supervised loss to decide which API calls are actually helpful.\\n\\n\\nExecute each API call $c_i$ to get corresponding result $r_i$.\\n\\n\\nCompute weighted cross entropy loss for the LM over tokens $x_i, \\\\dots, x_n$ when the model is prefixed with the prompt. Two versions are computed, one with API result and the other with empty sequence $\\\\varepsilon$.\\n\\n  $$\\n  \\\\begin{aligned}\\n  L^+_i &= L_i(e(c_i, r_i)) \\\\\\\\\\n  L^-_i &= \\\\min(L_i(\\\\varepsilon), L_i(e(c_i, \\\\varepsilon))) \\\\\\\\\\n  \\\\end{aligned}\\n  $$\\n  \\nOnly API calls with $L^-_i - L^+_i$ larger than a threshold are kept, meaning that adding this API call and its results help the model predict future tokens.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFine-tune LM on this annotated dataset. The new training sequences are constructed as $\\\\mathbf{x}^* = x_{1:i-1}, e(c_i, r_i), x_{i:n}$ . The training data is a combination of the original dataset (e.g. a subset of CCNet, as in the paper) and its augmented version.\\n\\n\\nAt inference time, decoding runs until the model produces “$\\\\to$ \" token, indicating that it is expecting response from an API call next.\\nToolformer currently does not support tool use in a chain (i.e. using the output of one tool as an input for another tool) or in an interactive way (i.e. adopt API response after human selection). Both are interesting future directions to expand the model for.\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Mar 2023). Prompt Engineering.

Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I know that LLM stands for Large Language Model. So, LLM-powered autonomous agents must be agents that use these models to function. The context mentions that the LLM serves as the agent’s brain, along with components like NLP, alignment, steerability, and prompting. \\n\\nPlanning in this context probably refers to how the agent breaks down tasks. The context talks about task decomposition, which is splitting a big task into smaller parts. So, planning would involve the agent figuring out the steps needed to achieve a goal.\\n\\nReflection is about self-reflection, as mentioned. This likely means the agent evaluates its own performance, maybe checking if it's following guidelines or if its actions are correct. It's like the agent thinking about how well it's doing and adjusting accordingly.\\n\\nPrompt engineering is about designing effective prompts to get the desired output from the LLM. In the context of agents, this would mean crafting prompts that help the agent understand tasks and act appropriately. It's about making sure the agent gets clear instructions.\\n\\nLangChain is a framework that connects LLMs with external data and tools. So, in LangChain, agents would use this framework to interact with the environment, using LLMs to process information and make decisions, and then take actions based on that.\\n\\nPutting it all together, planning is task decomposition, reflection is self-evaluation, and prompt engineering is about crafting good prompts. LangChain helps agents interact with the world using LLMs. The answer should explain these points clearly but concisely.\\n</think>\\n\\nLLM-powered autonomous agents use large language models as their core, enabling them to plan through task decomposition and reflect via self-evaluation.

This likely means the agent evaluates its own performance, maybe checking if it's following guidelines or if its actions are correct. It's like the agent thinking about how well it's doing and adjusting accordingly.\\n\\nPrompt engineering is about designing effective prompts to get the desired output from the LLM. In the context of agents, this would mean crafting prompts that help the agent understand tasks and act appropriately. It's about making sure the agent gets clear instructions.\\n\\nLangChain is a framework that connects LLMs with external data and tools. So, in LangChain, agents would use this framework to interact with the environment, using LLMs to process information and make decisions, and then take actions based on that.\\n\\nPutting it all together, planning is task decomposition, reflection is self-evaluation, and prompt engineering is about crafting good prompts. LangChain helps agents interact with the world using LLMs. The answer should explain these points clearly but concisely.\\n</think>\\n\\nLLM-powered autonomous agents use large language models as their core, enabling them to plan through task decomposition and reflect via self-evaluation. Prompt engineering involves designing effective prompts to guide the agent's actions. LangChain facilitates interaction with external systems, allowing agents to process information and act based on LLM outputs.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 416, 'prompt_tokens': 225, 'total_tokens': 641, 'completion_time': 1.997812234, 'prompt_time': 0.014398077, 'queue_time': 1.69690166, 'total_time': 2.012210311}, 'model_name': 'deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_1bbe7845ec', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--38da90d0-92f1-475a-b868-6a51931e569e-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 225, 'output_tokens': 416, 'total_tokens': 641})]}"
